To perform Threat Assessment and Risk Analysis (TARA) of a case study, the following steps need to performed in sequence:

1. Start off with designing architecural model of the system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs). A general layout (schematic) of the system may be used for this purpose.  A team of Cybersecurity experts and system developers may perform this task jointly. For demonstartion purposes here, the system of evaluation (SOE) is a diagnostic network connected to the ECM on CAN BUS 1 network. A simplified diagram of the SOE is given below:

The SOE is translated into Data Flow Diagram based on the function assignment i.e. establishing a diagnostic session and network data flow.
